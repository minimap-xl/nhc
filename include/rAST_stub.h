/* This header contains an incomplete (stub) definition of data type
   AST.  It is used to break circular references between the complete
   definition of struct AST_node, in rAST.h and the various data types
   defined in def_... headers.  With this rather classic approach:

   - def_... headers include rAST_stub.h.  This should be enough
     because all they need is AST *.  Being a pointer, it can be
     compiled even without yet knowing the exact structure of AST.

   - rAST.h includes the def_... headers it needs, which also bring in
     the stub definition, and then proceeds to define struct AST_node
     completely.

/* I: Use a custom data type for a symbol id.  This should make it
   easier to have code that works both with and without symbol
   interning.

   With interning: typedef uint32_t symbolId_t;
   Without interning: typedef AST *symbolId_t;

   Anticipate this type definition here in the stub because some
   prototypes in the def_ headers need it.

   I TBD: For the time being, do without interning, AST_getSymbolId is
   a pass-through and the id of a symbol is the pointer to its AST
   node.  Note that in this way id is not going to be unique.
