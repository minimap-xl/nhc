/* This header provides a full definition of struct AST_node, while
   rAST_stub.h contains the corresponding stub definition.  Each AST
   node is described by a struct AST_node, also called AST thanks to
   the typedef in the stub.  The structure contains:

   1)  enum proc_optional_block op;
       struct  symbol_value value;

       These fields are required/dictated by the CPAL parser.

   2)  enum ast_node_code code;

	   A code/tag which indicates the node type, see TT's comments in
	   the commit log of r725

   3)  struct ast_node_common common;

       A data structure common to all possible types of AST nodes.

   4)  union { ... } ast_node_specific;

	   A container for data structures specific to each node type.

   This definition must come before we include any def_... headers
   because their function prototype make use of AST *.
